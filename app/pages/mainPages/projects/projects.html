          <p>In this project, my employee was Marktech Services, an affiliate company with Medisolutions.
            My role was to engineer the front-end architecture and build  user interfaces for the
            Medisolutions web applications that are used by pharmaceutical companies, laboratories and
            medical doctors in the USA. Some among others can be viewed at:

        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>This project required a knowledge base for the management of IT knowledge to
            be used as an internal knowledge source for a Bank. The Company I worked for,
            called Next Pathway Inc. Toronto, Ontario was sub-contracted by this Bank to
            build their software. The key point of this project was to be responsive, cross browser
            portable, and to display static pages to be served by the back-end.
            My job was to build the front-end with HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.

          <p>   The Nexus 7 Tablet was to be used in the Medical Operation Room,
            to have it display Neuro-Muscular Stimuli data from a medical
            device connected to the patient's body by muscular sensors.
          </p>

          <p>   This Nexus 7 Tablet came without any user interface, though an Android browser
            was present. My job was to build the HTML5 User interface, controlled
            by JavaScript and JQuery and styled with plain Cascading Style Sheets.
